For this tutorial we are going to build a Login/Signup page with React, Docker and PostgreSQL

The folder structure for this project will look something like this:

```javascript
client
server
```

For now let's get started with the easy stuff, setting up our react front-end environment

Go ahead and create a new project folder and cd into that.

*terminal*
```javascript
C:Users\Desktop\ mkdir loginPage
C:Users\Desktop\ cd loginPage
```

Now let's create the front-end of our site by running our create-react-app command and cd into our app

*terminal*
```javascript
npm create-react-app client
C:Users\Desktop\loginPage cd client
```
