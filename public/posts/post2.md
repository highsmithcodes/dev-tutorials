If you're anything like me, you like to make projects on the internet for little to no cost. Netlify has been my go to hosting solution to resolve all of my penny pinching anxiety. You can not only get started with Netlify using a free account, but deployment comes with a really streamlined and well documented interface. 

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to deploy your project to Netlify using your github account. 


*terminal*
```javascript
git add .
```

```javascript
git commit -m "add deployment to netlify"
```
and depending on which branch your github files are on, the following command could point to either "main" or "master"
```javascript
git push origin main
```


And that should be all we need to start building out our React Project with JSON Data.
